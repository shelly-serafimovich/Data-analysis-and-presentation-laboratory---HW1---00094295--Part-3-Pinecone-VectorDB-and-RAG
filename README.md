# Data-analysis-and-presentation-laboratory---HW1---00094295--Part-3-Pinecone-VectorDB-and-RAG
 ## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled "Lab_HW1_O3" which demonstrates the implementation and usage of a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline. The notebook covers the integration of various components such as an embedding model, a vector database, and a large language model (LLM) to effectively retrieve and generate answers to user queries.

## Introduction
In this notebook, we explore the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline, which combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models. The pipeline consists of three main components:

- *An embedding model for generating vector representations of text.*
- *A vector database to store and retrieve these embeddings.*
- *A large language model (LLM) to generate responses based on the retrieved information*.
- *We utilize the sentence-transformer model for embeddings, Pinecone for the vector database, and Cohere's chat API for the LLM.*

## Results
The notebook provides a comprehensive demonstration of the RAG pipeline, showcasing its ability to efficiently retrieve and generate accurate responses to user queries. Below are some example queries:

- Query: "Who are the Greek 200 meter sprinters who retired from the Olympic Games in Athens?"
- Query: "In a friendly soccer match between Germany and Cameroon, what was the result of the match?"
- Query: "In the 2005-2006 season, the Cleveland Cavaliers rejected the contract of the player Dajuan Wagner, who became a free agent, what was the amount of the contract?"
